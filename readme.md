## Introduction
AltStack is a boilerplate meant to standardize much of the setup that almost every web application needs. 
Reclaim your first few hours of development on every new project by allowing AltStack to give you a 
little speed boost.

This is the Laravel template with Tailwind, Alpine.js, and Livewire as default preset and ships with some
features like user management with UUID for primary key, and Two Factor Authentication. I'm using this
template for (nearly) all my personal projects and professional projects, but you may use my template but
please notice that we offer no support whatsoever. We also don't follow semver for this project and won't
guarantee that the code (especially the master branch) is stable.

> In short: when using this, you're on your own.

## Quick Start
At least you will need `PHP >= 7.3` and `Nodejs >= 12.16`. For database backend, you can choose between
`PostgreSQL >= 9.6` or `MySQL >= 5.7` or `MariaDB >= 10.3` or any other database engine that supported
by Laravel. Also, you maybe want to use `Redis >= 3.2` for session store and or caching storage.

By default I'm using PostgreSQL for main database. But, you can change it via `.env` configuration file.

### Create PostgreSQL database
```sql
-- sudo -u postgres psql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS "homestead"; DROP ROLE IF EXISTS "homestead";
CREATE ROLE "homestead" SUPERUSER CREATEDB CREATEROLE LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'securepwd';
CREATE DATABASE "homestead"; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "homestead" TO "homestead";
```

### Create New Project
```bash
# Use latest version:
composer create-project riipandi/altstack <app_name>

# If you want to use spesific version:
composer create-project riipandi/altstack <app_name> <version>
```

Change `<app_name>` with your own and `<version>` with release version.
See [release page][releasepage] for the version number.

#### Package Version
The versioning number will follow the release of the Laravel version, followed by the package release number:

```
x.y  =>  x is Laravel version, y are Alt Stack version.
7.5  =>  Laravel 7.x.x, Alt Stack revision 5.
```

### Local Installation
Edit or create `.env` file and then execute:

```bash
# Composer dependencies
composer install --no-suggest
php artisan key:generate --force
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Publish vendor components
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=blade-heroicons --force
php artisan livewire:publish --assets --force

# Compiling resources
npm install --no-optional --no-audit
npm run dev
```
