## Introduction
AltStack is a boilerplate meant to standardize much of the setup that almost every web 
application needs. Reclaim your first few hours of development on every new project by 
allowing AltStack to give you a little speed boost.

This is the Laravel template use Tailwind and Alpine.js as default preset and ships with 
some features like user management with UUID for primary key, and Two Factor Authentication.
I'm using this template for (nearly) all my personal projects and professional projects, 
but you may use my template but please notice that we offer no support whatsoever.

We don't follow semver for this project and won't guarantee that the code (especially the 
master branch) is stable.

> In short: when using this, you're on your own.

## Quick Start
At least you will need `PHP >= 7.4` and `Nodejs >= 12.16`. For database backend, you can 
choose between `PostgreSQL >= 9.6` or `MySQL >= 5.7` or `MariaDB >= 10.3` or any other 
database engine that supported by Laravel. Also, you maybe want to use `Redis >= 3.2` for 
session store and or caching storage.

By default I'm using PostgreSQL for main database. But, you can change it via `.env`
configuration file.

### Prepare the database
```sql
-- If using PostgreSQL: sudo -u postgres psql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS "homestead"; DROP ROLE IF EXISTS "homestead";
CREATE ROLE "homestead" SUPERUSER CREATEDB CREATEROLE LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'securepwd';
CREATE DATABASE "homestead"; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "homestead" TO "homestead";

-- If using MariaDB 10.x: mysql -uroot -p
DROP USER IF EXISTS `homestead`@`localhost`;
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS `homestead`; CREATE DATABASE `homestead`;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `homestead`.* TO `homestead`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY 'securepwd' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

### Create New Project
```bash
# Use latest version:
composer create-project riipandi/altstack <app_name>

# If you want to use spesific version:
composer create-project riipandi/altstack <app_name> <version>
```

Change `<app_name>` with your own and `<version>` with release version.
See [release page][releasepage] for the version number.

#### Package Version
The versioning number will follow the release of the Laravel version, followed by the 
package release number:

```
x.y  =>  x is Laravel version, y are AltStack version.
7.5  =>  Laravel 7.x.x, AltStack revision 5.
```

### Local Installation
Edit or create `.env` file and then execute:

```bash
# Composer dependencies
composer install --no-suggest

# Scaffolding application
php artisan key:generate --force
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=blade-heroicons --force

# Compiling resources
npm install --no-optional --no-audit
npm run development
```
